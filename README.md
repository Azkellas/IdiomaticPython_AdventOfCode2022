## What is this repository
This repository is a python course using the Advent of Code 2022 as reference to teach idiomatic python. It assumes the reader already has basic knowledge of programming and python (for loops, variables, etc.) to dive in higher level python.

## What is the Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (or aoc for short) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles made by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It's an event in the dev community that happens every december since 2015, with more than 200.000 people participating in 2021.
Puzzles can be solved in any language, sometimes in only 5mn, sometimes in a couple hours, depending of the day.

## How to follow this course
Readers are strongly encouraged to first try the puzzle before reading the breakdown. Participating in AOC requires an account on the website, as each input is unique. Then each day consists of a readme explaining how to solve the day idiomaticaly, and a python file with a full answer. The course assumes day were read in order to progress incrementally. If you think something is not explained but should have been, it was probably done in a previous day.

## Summary
